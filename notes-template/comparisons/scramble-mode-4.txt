 Chest:

 Clinical Details:
  Left sided chest pain on inspiration. Cough productive, colored sputum.

  Report:
   No old films available for comparison.
   Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is an undefined density in the left midzone which could representing developing infection or
   consolidation. There is blunting on the left   which could represent a small effusion. No pneumothorax and no free gas
   under the diaphram. No rib fractures are identified.

   IMPRESSION
    Illdefined left midzone , opacity with blunting of the left   could represent developing infection. Correlate with any fever and leukocytosis. Progress imaging is recommended to ensure resolution.

Radiopharmaceutical: 99m-Tc MAA/99m-Tc Technegas
Reported by Dr. N LIAJ
Clinical History:
 L. chest pain, tachycardia D-dimer 1.8
Technique:
 Ventilation and Perfusion SP.ECT images obtained followed by planar reconstructions.

 Report:
  A moderate sized matching defect is noted in the left upper lobe apical segment with a non segmental matching defect noted
  following the oblique fissure of the left sungs. There is however a small mismatched subsegmental perfusion defect noted involving the medical
  basal segment of the left lesser lobe. This is wedge shaped on the sagittal images and consistent with a small pulmonary embolisis.

  Conclusion:
   Findings consistent with a small acute pulmonary embolisis left lesser lobe medial basal segment left lesser lobe. The matching apical defect appears worse on ventilation images and may relate to an underlying parenchymal process.
