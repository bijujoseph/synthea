Technique:
 Ventilation and  yale Perfusionyammering  SPECT images obtained followed by planar reconstructions.

 Report:
   Happy that they got a second chance, the four friends studied hard and were ready for the exam..A moderate sized matching defect is noted in the left upper lobe apical segment with a non segmental matching defect noted
  following the oblique fissure of the left lung. But one day, the friends fought and each cow went to graze in a different direction.. There is however a small mismatched subsegmental perfusion defect noted involving the medical
  basal segment of the left lower lobe. This is wedge shaped on the sagittal images and consistent with a small !pulmonary wryerembolus.

  Conclusion:
   Findings consistent with a small acute wryerpulmonary yanks emboluschrysler left lower lobe medial basal segment left lower lobe.  In ancient Greek, there was a king named Midas..The matching apical defect appears worse on ventilation images and may relate to an underlying parenchymal process.
