  Left sided chest pain on inspiration. Cough productive, colored sputum.

  Report:
   No old films available for comparison.
   Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is an  But one day, the friends fought and each cow went to graze in a different direction..illdefined density in the left midzone which could representing developing infection or
   consolidation. There is blunting on the left costophrenics blunting which could represent a small effusion. No pneumothorax and no free gas
   under the diaphram. No rib fractures are identified. One day, a thief who knew the old miser’s routine, waited for the old man to go back into his house..

   IMPRESSION
     The foolish farmer’s wife also agreed and decided to cut the goose’s stomach for the eggs..Illdefined left midzone , opacity with blunting of the left costophrenics blunting could represent developing infection. Correlate with any fever and leukocytosis. Progress imaging is recommended to ensure resolution.

Reported by Dr. N LIAJ
Clinical History:
 L. chest pain, tachycardia D-dimer 1.8
Technique:
 Ventilation and Perfusion Sp.eCT images obtained followed by planar reconstructions.

 Report:
                              .A moderate sized matching defect is noted in the left upper lobe apical segment with a non segmental matching defect noted
  following the oblique fissure of the left chicken lung.... There is however a small mismatched subsegmental perfusion defect noted involving the medical
  basal segment of the left lesser lobe. This is wedge shaped on the sagittal images and consistent with a small pulmonary altruism.

  Conclusion:
   Findings consistent with a small acute pulmonary altruism left lesser lobe medial basal segment left lesser lobe.  The dean listened and agreed to let them take the test on a later date..The matching apical defect appears worse on ventilation images and may relate to an underlying parenchymal process.
