 Clinical:  Happy that they got a second chance, the four friends studied hard and were ready for the exam..Please compare with prior imaging. Known PE left base.
 Persisted pain. Examination consistent with developing effusions.

Report:
 Comparisons maide with study of  1980-07-17 011:29.
  As soon as they killed the bird and opened the goose’s stomach, to find nothing but guts and blood..There is left sided pleuraleffusion that has been developed in the interval period.
 There is adjacent compressive atelectasis. There is an opacity in the left mid zone that is noted previously.
 Cardiomediastinal borders are with normal range.         The right lung is clear. There is a small right sided pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax or free subphragmatic gas. One day, a satyr named Silenus got drunk and passed out in Midas’ rose garden..

 Chest:

 Clinical Details:
  Left sided chest pain on inspiration. Cough productive, colored sputum.

  Report:
   No old films available for comparison.
   Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is an illdefined density in the left midzone which could representing developing infection or
   consolidation. There is blunting on the left costophrenic angle which could represent a small effusion. No pneumothorax and no free gas
   under the diaphram. No rib fractures are identified. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.

   IMPRESSION
     They grazed together and stayed together, because of which no tigers or lions were able to kill them for food..Illdefined left midzone , opacity with blunting of the left costophrenic angle could represent developing infection. Correlate with any fever and leukocytosis. Progress imaging is recommended to ensure resolution.

 Reported: 1980-07-17 04:00

Radiopharmaceutical: 99m-Tc MAA/99m-Tc Technegas
Reported by Dr. N LIAJ
Clinical History:
 L. chest pain, tachycardia D-dimer 1.8
Technique:
 Ventilation and Perfusion SPECT images obtained followed by planar reconstructions.

 Report:
   The foolish farmer’s wife also agreed and decided to cut the goose’s stomach for the eggs..A moderate sized matching defect is noted in the left upper lobe apical segment with a non segmental matching defect noted
  following the oblique fissure of the left lung. Inside us there is something that has no name, that something is what we are.. There is however a small mismatched subsegmental perfusion defect noted involving the medical
  basal segment of the left lower lobe. This is wedge shaped on the sagittal images and consistent with a small pulmonary embolus.

  Conclusion:
   Findings consistent with a small acute pulmonary embolus left lower lobe medial basal segment left lower lobe.  The farmer, realizing his foolish mistake, cries over the lost resource!.The matching apical defect appears worse on ventilation images and may relate to an underlying parenchymal process.
