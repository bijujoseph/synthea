 Chest:
 
 Clinical Details: 
  Left sided chest pain on inspiration. Cough productive, colored sputum. 
  
  Report:
   No old films available for comparison. 
   Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is an illdefined density in the left midzone which could representing developing infection or 
   consolidation. There is blunting on the left costophrenic angle which could represent a small effusion. No pneumothorax and no free gas 
   under the diaphram. No rib fractures are identified. 
   
   IMPRESSION
    Illdefined left midzone , opacity with blunting of the left costophrenic angle could represent developing infection. Correlate with any fever and leukocytosis. Progress imaging is recommended to ensure resolution.

Radiopharmaceutical: 99m-Tc MAA/99m-Tc Technegas
Reported by Dr. N LIAJ
Clinical History:
 L. chest pain, tachycardia D-dimer 1.8    
Technique:
 Ventilation and Perfusion SPECT images obtained followed by planar reconstructions. 
 
 Report: 
  A moderate sized matching defect is noted in the left upper lobe apical segment with a non segmental matching defect noted 
  following the oblique fissure of the left lung. There is however a small mismatched subsegmental perfusion defect noted involving the medical
  basal segment of the left lower lobe. This is wedge shaped on the sagittal images and consistent with a small pulmonary embolus. 
  
  Conclusion: 
   Findings consistent with a small acute pulmonary embolus left lower lobe medial basal segment left lower lobe. The matching apical defect appears worse on ventilation images and may relate to an underlying parenchymal process.
